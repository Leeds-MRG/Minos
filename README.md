*Icarus* is a dynamic microsimulation used for comparison of transition probability models when predicting UK employment, education, and mental health states. 

It is being developed as part of Robert Clay's PhD project to be used in the SIPHER consortiums work on design of policy for intervention in 'inclusive economies'.
