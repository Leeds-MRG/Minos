*Minos* is a dynamic microsimulation being developed to investigate (firstly) the pathways in which an improvement to a national living wage could affect mental health outcomes. 

It is based on [**Icarus**](https://github.com/RobertClay/Icarus), which is another dynamic microsimulation model being developed as part of Robert Clay's PhD project, all being part of the SIPHER consortiums work on the design of policy for interventions in 'inclusive economies'.
