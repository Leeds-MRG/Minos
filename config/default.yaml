# REALLY IMPORTANT NOTE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD READ ME.
# The order of these listed components is important. They are initialised last one in first one off.
# All other components need the replenishment module which loads in real cohort data.
# The Replenishment component must be listed LAST here no matter what as it is the FIRST module used. (priority 0)
# Only if Replenishment needs some other module in the future would it be superceded.
# Similarly Mortality requires Replenishment but everything else requires Mortality so it goes second. (priority 1)
# Finally everything else can go in any order (priority 2).
