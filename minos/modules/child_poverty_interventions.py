# Doubling briding payment from 130 to 260 per month per child. analogous to child uplift.

# fuel insecurity fund to 20 million.
# constraining scotland to only use 20 million for energy expenditure.
# requires full scale population or reduction of money to be proportional.

#funding to Local authorities for more flexible management of energy bills. seems idealistic and hard to implement without extensive data on how each LA would react. needs much more research.
# again needs full spatial population as MINOS input.

#moratorium on rent/evictions. not sure how easy this would be. can freeze rents but no eviction variables.

# debt relief on most financially vulnerable. (again no debt variables.) have financial condition variables which may be useful instead?

# island households fund. spatial policy should be easy to cut by island super outputs but need a list of them from somewhere (spatial policy...).
