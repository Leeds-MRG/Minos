    """ Get aggregate values for value v using method function. Do this over the specified source and years.
    A MINOS batch run under a certain intervention will produce 1000 files over 10 years and 100 iterations.
    These files will all be in the source directory.
    For each year this function grabs all files. If the model runs from 2010-2020 there would be 100 files for 2010.
    For each file within a year the method function is used over variable v.
    The default is taking the mean over SF12 using np.nanmean.
    For each file this will produce a scalar value.
    This scalar value is used along with a year and tag tag as a row in the output dataframe df.
    These tags determine which year and which source the dataframe row belongs to.
    If the source is a £25 uplift intervention the tag tag will correspond to this.
    This is used later by sns.lineplot.
    This is repeated over all years to produce an output dataframe with 1000 rows.
    Each row is an aggregated v value for each iteration and year pair.
    Parameters
    ----------
    source: str
        What directory is being aggregated. E.g. output/baseline/
    years, v : list
        What range of years are being used. What set of variables are being aggregated.
    tag: str
        Which data source are being processed. adds a tag column to the df with this tag.
    method: func
    Returns
    -------
    df: pd.DataFrame
