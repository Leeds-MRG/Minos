"""
This script reweights input populations to MINOS to ensure the starting and replenishment populations are representative
now and into the future.

The two sources of data for reweighting populations are the midyear estimates from 2008 - 2020, and the principal
population projections from 2021 - 2070 (principal projections can be extended to 2120 but I doubt MINOS will ever
want to model that far into the future, ~50 years seems like a reasonable maximum but can be expanded if necessary).

Currently we take the 16 year olds from the final data file for 2018 (start date of the simulations), generate identical
copies of this population for every year of the simulation to 2070, then adjust the analysis weights (`weight` var) by
sex and ethnicity to ensure representative populations into the future.
