    """Correct data that is deterministically missing.
    Requires a data frame, a column to correct, a condition function for correction,
    and a function which decides what to replace missing values with.
    Examples
    --------
    data : US data frame
    columns :  List of columns to update deterministically.
    conditioner : function that returns True if a person is unemployed. False otherwise.
    replacer: function that returns 0 regardless of other individual attributes.
    Parameters
    ----------
    data : pd.DataFrame
        The data to correct data for.
    columns : list
        Which column to correct data for.
    conditioner, replacer : func
        A conditional function which takes the data and returns a column of booleans.
        These booleans determine which individuals are having data replaced.
        Replacer will determine what these missing values are replaced with.
        This can be a simple deterministic function, or determined by within/cross individual attributes.
