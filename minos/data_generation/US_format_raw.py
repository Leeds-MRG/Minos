""" There seems to be a gap between 2007-2008 where people who were in the old 
study do not transfer to the new one until next year. Need to find out why this is.

This is most likely me missing some variable in the data which would better serve
as a time variable. (e.g. interview year/month).

For now just assume the end of BHPS and start of ukhls occur in the same year.
Record years by the END date. The first wave is SEP 90 - SEP 91 so is recorded as

"""
Load persistent JSON data dictionaries for US. These are data dictionaries that simplify categorical variables
from integers to strings for easier readability. Its easier to see white british, black-african than digits 1, 5.

These dictionaries also simplify some variables for use in a microsim. 
E.g. education state has a large number of equivalent qualifications (O-Level, GCSE, CSE, etc.) compressed into one.
While this destroys some detail it makes it much easier to make transition models particularly for rare items.

NOTE there are some time dependent dictionaries here. BHPS changes formatting in 2002 for ethnicity so there are 
two ethnicity dictionaries to reflect that. The time prefix indicates when the change takes place or the end of the 
dataset (2008 for BHPS).
