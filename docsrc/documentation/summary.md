# SIPHER - Minos Model

Living Wage and Mental Health: Basic Model

- Assumes – same job (and no intensification of work/higher productivity), same number of hours
- Only looks at impact on the individual receiving the living wage (not household/children or at area level)
- Does not yet include impact of wage increase on Universal Credit receipt
- Need to sex stratify modelling as might impact women and men differently/disproportionately

Living Wage ----- income increase of X ---- **Pathways** ---- Improved Mental Health

**Pathways**

1. Psychosocial: Improvement in social status/esteem, financial independence (including from benefit system stigma etc)
2. Material improvements in:
  1. Behaviour: Nutrition (food security, hunger, better quality food)
  2. Behaviour: Alcohol and tobacco consumption (increase/decrease?)
  3. Housing quality (decent homes = less damp, warmer, housing security)
  4. Moving home (could mean less overcrowding, better neighbourhood with more green space, different cultural norms, better recreational and health care facilities, better food outlets, less tobacco and alcohol outlets, less crime and anti-social behaviours)
  5. More social inclusion (e.g. more ability to participate in leisure activities e.g. sports, cinema, or pub)
3. Psychosocial - Financial security – less chronic stress/worry
